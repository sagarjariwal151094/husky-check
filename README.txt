Ans: Yes, you can create different shipping zones as per your requirements (like countries/states/zipcodes). Based on that different zones you can create different shipping methods and charge extra shipping cost with shipping rules.

= Q. I want to apply shipping methods based on the amount after applying the coupon code to cart subtotal. Can I achieve this? (Upgrade to Pro version) =
Ans: Yes, you can achieve this functionality. For that, you have to set the conditions for cart subtotal (After discount). Like you can set cart subtotal (After discount) greater than 50. When after subtracting the amount cart subtotal and coupon code is greater than 50 then shipping method is applied.
